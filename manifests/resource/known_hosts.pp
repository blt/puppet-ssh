# Creates, modifies or destroys an ssh known_hosts file.
#
# This resource will not create the root directory nor the user: construct them
# ahead of time.
#
# An auxiliary file containing a single hash of the provided hosts will be
# created in the root directory. Please do not delete it; all security
# precautions comiserate to those taken by known_hosts are taken with regard to
# the hosts' hash file.
#
# Parameters:
#
#  [*ensure*] - Sets the presence of the known_hosts file (present|absent).
#   *hosts*   - Comma separated list of hostnames to compile into known_hosts file.
#   *user*    - User to create known_hosts file for.
#  [*root*]   - Parent directory known_hosts file. Default /home/USER/.ssh
